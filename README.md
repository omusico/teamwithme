# About

Team With Me aims to match up lone hackers at hackathons.
We take a Tinder-like approach to matching hackers with a team.
Hackers sign up, providing some quick details about their experience, what they want to learn, and what they want to use in their hack.
Next, hackers swipe to let the app know who they do and do not want to team up with.
When two hackers want to team up, we let them know to help something beautiful happen.

Team With Me was started at VThacks (February 2015) by Marisa Gomez, Nathan Hilliard. John Salis. Alex Ordonez, and Katie Porterfield. VTHacks was the largest and longest hackathon most of these members had been to at the time. Marisa and Katie were mainly introduced to Android development. The whole team was enrolled in the Big Data Mining and Analytics course at Stetson University, so everyone wanted to work with some data to analyze. Many sponsors offered enormous APIs, but the team decided to create our own data - user information including repositories from GitHub, preferred languages, preferred roles on teams, and a bunch of binary replies about which hackers wanted to team up with other hackers.
