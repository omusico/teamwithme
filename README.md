# About

Team With Me aims to match up lone hackers at hackathons.
We take a Tinder-like approach to matching hackers with a team.
Hackers sign up, providing some quick details about their experience, what they want to learn, and what they want to use in their hack.
Next, hackers swipe to let the app know who they do and do not want to team up with.
When two hackers want to team up, we let them know to help something beautiful happen.
